    <h1>Project</h1>
    <p>This project is a translation of Alex Ayala's Lunar Lander project from Fundamentals of Computing. 
    The original project was written in C++ and this project is written in Python 3 using <a href="https://pygame-zero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Pygame Zero</a>.
    This inspiration for this project came from a desire to translate Alex's old code into an updated Python version. 
    Our end goal for this project was to have a working game with improvements from the old version. Some updates that we included
    were the addition of sound and updated fonts.
    </p>
    
    <h1>How to use</h1>
    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <p>There are two ways to install the project. One is via a package and the next is via cloning the GitHub repository.</p>
    <h3>Package</h3>
    <p>The package has all necessary files to run the game. All you need to do is make sure to have Python 3 and <a href="https://pygame-zero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Pygame Zero</a>
    installed. Feel free to view the <a href="https://github.com/aayala4/Lunar-Lander-Python/releases/tag/1.0.0">official release</a> as well.
    </p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/aayala4/Lunar-Lander-Python/blob/master/packages/lunarlanderpython.tar.gz?raw=true">Click here for the tar package.</a></p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/aayala4/Lunar-Lander-Python/blob/master/packages/lunarlanderpython.zip?raw=true">Click here for the zip package.</a></p>
    <h3>Git Cloning</h3>
    <p>To install the project via Git Cloning, clone the <a href="https://github.com/aayala4/Lunar-Lander-Python/">GitHub repository</a>. Make sure that
    you have the latest version of Python 3 and <a href="https://pygame-zero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Pygame Zero</a> installed. Next, you need to download the font pack to get the game to work.
    The instructions to do that are found <a href="https://github.com/aayala4/Lunar-Lander-Python/blob/master/fonts/readme">in this readme</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Note</h3>
    <p>The old C++ files that our project is based off of can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/aayala4/Lunar-Lander-Python/tree/master/cppLander">cppLander folder</a> in our repository.
    <h2>Running the Game</h2>
    <p>
    To run the program, double check that you have Python 3 and Pygame Zero installed.
    Our main python file is <code>lunarLander.py</code>.
    Next, simply run the command <code>[PYTHON EXECUTABLE] lunarLander.py</code>. Note: the <code>[PYTHON EXECUTABLE]</code> in the previous command
    must be a working version of the python 3 interpreter. 
    </p>
    <h2>Screenshots</h2>
    <p>Below are screenshots from the game.</p>

    <p>To play, use the arrow keys as shown on the photo above. The other instructions are above in the title page.</p>
    <h3>Gameplay</h3>

    <p>Here is what the screen will look like during normal gameplay.</p>
    <h3>Fuel</h3>
    <p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aayala4/Lunar-Lander-Python/master/images/outoffuel.png" alt="Out of Fuel" /></p>
    <p>The rocket gets a certain amount of fuel per round. When the fuel expires, the game is done. The image above shows the screen
    when you run out of fuel</p>
    <h3>Crash<h3>
    <p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aayala4/Lunar-Lander-Python/master/images/crash.png" alt="Crash" /></p>
    <p>If you land too fast or don't land with the ship in a vertical angle, you will crash the ship. The photo above shows this.</p>
